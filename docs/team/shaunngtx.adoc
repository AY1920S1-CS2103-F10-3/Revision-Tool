== PROJECT: RevisionTools - V1.4

---

== Overview

RevisionTool is a Desktop application used as a personal tool for revisions and self-quizzes.
The user interacts with it using a CLI, and it has a GUI created with JavaFX. It is written in Java and
has about 14 kLoC.

== Summary of contributions

* *Major enhancement*: added *the Restore Command function*
** What it does: allows the user to restore their current Question Bank to the default question bank.
** Justification: This feature improves the product rather significantly as users tend to over-add questions and this would allow them to revert their Question Bank to the default bank
as a form of "Restart", as most of our default questions are taken from the weekly lecture quiz questions.
** Highlights: This enhancement affects existing commands and commands to be added in future. It required an in-depth analysis of design alternatives. The implementation too was
challenging as it required changes to existing commands and models.

* *Major enhancement*: added *the Auto Complete function*
** What it does: shows the user a list of possible AutoCompleted commands while they are typing in which they select in order to simplify things for the user.
** Justification: This feature improves the product significantly because for a CLI, users have to do a lot of typing and this greatly eases the amount of work they have to do, and
reap the maximum benefits from the application.
** Highlights: This enhancement required in-depth analysis of design alternatives as the implementation required changes to the commandBox which was used in almost every file which
had a textBox in it. A significant amount of thought was placed into the implementation as well as I had to formulate what sort of AutoComplete would be most intuitive and value-add to users.
