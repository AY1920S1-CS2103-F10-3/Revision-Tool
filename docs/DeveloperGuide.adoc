== Setting up

Refer to the guide <<SettingUp#, here>>.

== Design

[[Design-Architecture]]

=== Architecture

.Architecture Diagram
image::ArchitectureDiagram.png[]

The *_Architecture Diagram_* given above explains the high-level design of the App. Given below is a quick overview of each component.

[TIP]
The `.puml` files used to create diagrams in this document can be found in the link:{repoURL}/docs/diagrams/[diagrams] folder.
Refer to the <<UsingPlantUml#, Using PlantUML guide>> to learn how to create and edit diagrams.

`Main` has two classes called link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/Main.java[`Main`] and link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/MainApp.java[`MainApp`]. It is responsible for,

* At app launch: Initializes the components in the correct sequence, and connects them up with each other.
* At shut down: Shuts down the components and invokes cleanup method where necessary.

<<Design-Commons,*`Commons`*>> represents a collection of classes used by multiple other components.
The following class plays an important role at the architecture level:

* `LogsCenter` : Used by many classes to write log messages to the App's log file.

The rest of the App consists of four components.

* <<Design-Ui,*`UI`*>>: The UI of the App.
* <<Design-Logic,*`Logic`*>>: The command executor.
* <<Design-Model,*`Model`*>>: Holds the data of the App in-memory.
* <<Design-Storage,*`Storage`*>>: Reads data from, and writes data to, the hard disk.

Each of the four components

* Defines its _API_ in an `interface` with the same name as the Component.
* Exposes its functionality using a `{Component Name}Manager` class.

For example, the `Logic` component (see the class diagram given below) defines it's API in the `Logic.java` interface and exposes its functionality using the `LogicManager.java` class.

==== How the architecture components interact with each other

The _Sequence Diagram_ below shows how the components interact with each other for the scenario where the user issues the command `delete 1`.

.Component interactions for `delete 1` command
image::ArchitectureSequenceDiagram2.png[]

The sections below give more details of each component.

[[Design-Ui]]
=== UI component
//tag::junxian-ui[]
.Structure of the UI Component
image::UiClassDiagram.png[]

*API* : link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/Ui.java[`Ui.java`]

The abstract class `ParentWindow` consists of individual Ui parts e.g.`CommandBox`, `ResultDisplay`, `AnswerableListPanel`, `StatusBarFooter` etc. All Ui classes inherit from the abstract `UiPart` class.
The `UI` component uses JavaFx UI framework. The layout of these UI parts are defined in matching `.fxml` files that are in the `src/main/resources/view` folder. For example, the layout of the link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/MainWindow.java[`MainWindow`] is specified in link:{repoURL}/src/main/resources/view/MainWindow.fxml[`MainWindow.fxml`]

The `MainWindow` inherits from the `ParentWindow` class and handles the display of information in the configuration mode. Key responsibilities of the `MainWindow` include

* Execute user commands through the `CommandBox` using the `Logic` component.
* Listen for changes to `Model` data so that the UI can be updated to reflect the modified data. This occurs for two types of situations
** Direct modification to the information inside the Answerables List, such as `AddCommand` or `EditCommand`
** Filtering of the currently shown list, for commands such as `FindCommand` and `ListCommand`

The `StartQuizWindow` inherits from the `ParentWindow` class and handles the display of information during quiz mode. It has an additional `ScoreProgressAndTimerGridPane` Ui component, which
is used to contain score progress and timer related Ui. Key responsibilities of the `StartQuizWindow` include

* Execute user answer input, e.g. "A", "B", "C", "D" for `Mcq`
* Adapt to changes in the current `Answerable` and update the Ui accordingly based on a few typical situations
** from the four options of `Mcq` to the two options for `TrueFalse`
** update the progress bar for every question
** update the timer every second and switch to the next question when countdown reaches 0.

[[Design-Logic]]
=== Logic component
//tag::shaun-logic[]
==== Overview of Logic Component

[[fig-LogicClassDiagram]]
.Structure of the Logic Component
image::LogicClassDiagram.png[]

*API* :
link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/logic/Logic.java[`Logic.java`]

.  `Logic` uses the `RevisionToolParser` class to parse the user command.
.  This results in a `Command` object which is executed by the `LogicManager`.
.  The command execution can affect the `Model` (e.g. adding a question).
.  The result of the command execution is encapsulated as a `CommandResult` object which is passed back to the `Ui`.
.  In addition, the `CommandResult` object can also instruct the `Ui` to perform certain actions, such as displaying help to the user.

//end::shaun-logic[]

//tag::wilfred-logic[]
==== Managing parsing in Configuration and Quiz Mode
During a quiz session a `QuizParser` instead of `Parser` is used.

.Class Diagram of ParserManager to display how parsers are created in both modes.
image::ParserClassDiagram.png[width=500]

As different commands are accepted in Configuration and Quiz Mode, the `ParserManager` class uses overloaded methods to
decide the valid commands in each mode. The following are the parsers used in each mode:

* ABCParser:
** AddCommandParser
** DeleteCommandParser
** EditCommandParser
** FindCommandParser
** ListCommandParser
** StartCommandParser

* XYZParser:
** McqInputCommandParser
** TfInputCommandParser
** SaqInputCommandParser

==== Parsing in Configuration Mode
In Configuration Mode, a single string is passed as an argument to the execute method.
Given below is the Sequence Diagram for interactions within the `Logic` component for the `execute("delete 1")` API call.

.Interactions Inside the Logic Component for the `delete 1` Command
image::DeleteSequenceDiagram.png[]

NOTE: The lifeline for `DeleteCommandParser` should end at the destroy marker (X) but due to a limitation of PlantUML, the lifeline reaches the end of diagram.

==== Parsing in Quiz Mode
In Quiz Mode, a string and the current `Answerable` object are passed as arguments to the execute method.
Given below is the Sequence Diagram for interactions within the `Logic` component for the `execute("c", answerable)` API call.

.Interactions Inside the Logic Component for the `c` input command.
image::QuizSequenceDiagram.png[width=790]

Key differences between parsing in Configuration Mode and Quiz Mode:

. In Quiz Mode, `Answerable#isCorrect(answer)` is called from the `McqInputCommand` to check whether the user's answer is correct.
. After which, the result is used to construct a `CommandResult` will be passed back to the `LogicManager`
. Lastly, the `Model` is accessed to update the user's score history.

[NOTE]
`CommandResult` is built using a builder design to allow flexibility of values returned to the `LogicManager`.
To guard against null values, default values are provided to every field in the `CommandResult` class upon construction.
Objects that call `CommandResult` can choose to customise `CommandResult` according to their needs.
//end::wilfred-logic[]

//tag::shaun-designmodel[]
[[Design-Model]]
=== Model component

.Structure of the Model Component
image::ModelClassDiagram2.png[]

*API* : link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/Model.java[`Model.java`]

The `Model`,

* stores a `QuestionBank` object that represents the Question Bank.
* stores the Question Bank data.
* exposes an unmodifiable `ObservableList<Answerable>` that can be 'observed' e.g. the UI can be bound to this list so that the UI automatically updates when the data in the list change.
* does not depend on any of the other three components.
//end::shaun-designmodel[]

//tag::wilfred-answerable[]
==== The `Answerable` Class

.Class Diagram of the Answerable Class
image::AnswerableClassDiagram.png[]

The main class that the Revision Tool operates on is the `Answerable` class.

Each `Answerable` class must have 1 `Question`, 1 `Difficulty` and can have any amount of categories associated with it.
The amount of answers that an `Answerable` can have depends on its type.

There are 3 subclasses of the `Answerable` Class which are: `Mcq`, `TrueFalse` and `Saq`. Each class defines it's
own rules on the validity of `Answer` s provided to it.

The following are the rules of validity for each subclass:

* Mcq: 4 answers in total. 1 correct answer, 3 wrong answers.
* TrueFalse: Either 'true' or 'false' as its answer.
* Saq: Any amount of answers.
[NOTE]
For all subclasses, there cannot be any duplicates of answers. For example, if an Mcq class has "option1" as one of its
wrong answers, it cannot have "option1" as its correct answer or another wrong answer.
//end::wilfred-answerable[]

//tag::shaun-storage[]
[[Design-Storage]]
=== Storage component

.Structure of the Storage Component
image::StorageClassDiagram2.png[]

*API* : link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/storage/Storage.java[`Storage.java`]

The `Storage` component,

* can save `Question Bank` objects in json format and read it back.
* can save the Test Bank data in json format and read it back.
//end::shaun-storage[]

[[Design-Commons]]
=== Common classes

Classes used by multiple components are in the `seedu.revision.commons` package.

== Implementation

This section describes some noteworthy details on how certain features are implemented.

//tag::shaun-add[]

=== Add questions feature
==== Implementation

The add questions mechanism is facilitated by `AddCommand`.
It extends `Command` that will read a user command and execute the command result.
Additionally, it implements the following operations:

* `AddCommand#addMcq()` -- Adds a mcq question to the test bank.
* `AddCommand#addShortAns()` -- Adds a short answer question to the test bank.

These operations are exposed in the `Model` interface as `Model#addMcqCommand()` and `Model#addShortAnsCommand()` respectively.

Given below is an example usage scenario and how the add questions mechanism behaves at each step.

Step 1. The user types `add type/mcq q/"string of question" x/option1 x/option2 y/option3 x/option4 cat/[UML] diff/[easy]`, this command adds a easy difficulty mcq question about UML with 4 options and option3 being the correct answer.

image::InitialState.png[]

Step 2. The command is being parse into the parser and the AddCommand object of type Command will be created.

image::FirstState.png[]

Step 3. The AddCommand object will call its `addMcq()` method, this method will read the command and store the question with the answers into the `test bank` accordingly.

image::SecondState.png[]

[NOTE]
If a command fails its execution, it will not save the question into the `revision tool`. It will however throw an invalid command exception.
//end::shaun-add[]

==== Design Considerations

===== Aspect: How add executes

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Read and parse the command to execute it
** Pros: Easy to implement.
** Cons: May have performance issues in terms of memory usage.

===== Aspect: Format of the add command

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Use a single line containing all the information of the question.
** Pros: Faster for user to add a question.
** Cons: Hard for user to memorize the long sequence which may cause invalid command input.
* **Alternative 2:** Use multiple steps to guide user on adding the question.
** Pros: User do not have to memorize the correct format and less chance for an invalid command input.
** Cons: Slow to add questions, requiring multiple steps to fully complete a question.

//tag::wilfred-quiz[]
=== Quiz Mode
==== How the quiz works
After the user has `start` ed the quiz, the application enters quiz mode. The following is the flow of events after a quiz
session has started.

.Activity Diagram of a Quiz Session in `NormalMode`
image::QuizSessionActivityDiagram.png[width=790]

. After the user has started either a normal / custom mode quiz. He/she will be prompted to key in their answer.
. If the input is valid, the revision tool will display the subsequent question until the level / entire quiz has ended.
. If the input is invalid, the revision tool will prompt the user to key in their input again with guidance provided on
the commands accepted.
. If the time limit is exceeded (e.g. 30 seconds in Normal Mode), the revision tool will mark the question as wrong and
move on to the next question.
. Once a level has ended, the user will be given the choice to move on to the next level or exit the quiz.
. Once the entire quiz has ended, the user will be given the choice to restart or exit the quiz.

[NOTE]
For Arcade Mode, when a users enters a wrong answer, the quiz will end.

// tag::dataencryption[]
=== [Proposed] Data Encryption

_{Explain here how the data encryption feature will be implemented}_

// end::dataencryption[]

=== Logging

We are using `java.util.logging` package for logging. The `LogsCenter` class is used to manage the logging levels and logging destinations.

* The logging level can be controlled using the `logLevel` setting in the configuration file (See <<Implementation-Configuration>>)
* The `Logger` for a class can be obtained using `LogsCenter.getLogger(Class)` which will log messages according to the specified logging level
* Currently log messages are output through: `Console` and to a `.log` file.

*Logging Levels*

* `SEVERE` : Critical problem detected which may possibly cause the termination of the application
* `WARNING` : Can continue, but with caution
* `INFO` : Information showing the noteworthy actions by the App
* `FINE` : Details that is not usually noteworthy but may be useful in debugging e.g. print the actual list instead of just its size

[[Implementation-Configuration]]
=== Configuration

Certain properties of the application can be controlled (e.g user prefs file location, logging level) through the configuration file (default: `config.json`).
