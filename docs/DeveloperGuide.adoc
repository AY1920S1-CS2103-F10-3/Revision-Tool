== Setting up

Refer to the guide <<SettingUp#, here>>.

== Design

[[Design-Architecture]]

=== Architecture

.Architecture Diagram
image::ArchitectureDiagram.png[]

The *_Architecture Diagram_* given above explains the high-level design of the App. Given below is a quick overview of each component.

[TIP]
The `.puml` files used to create diagrams in this document can be found in the link:{repoURL}/docs/diagrams/[diagrams] folder.
Refer to the <<UsingPlantUml#, Using PlantUML guide>> to learn how to create and edit diagrams.

`Main` has two classes called link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/Main.java[`Main`] and link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/MainApp.java[`MainApp`]. It is responsible for,

* At app launch: Initializes the components in the correct sequence, and connects them up with each other.
* At shut down: Shuts down the components and invokes cleanup method where necessary.

<<Design-Commons,*`Commons`*>> represents a collection of classes used by multiple other components.
The following class plays an important role at the architecture level:

* `LogsCenter` : Used by many classes to write log messages to the App's log file.

The rest of the App consists of four components.

* <<Design-Ui,*`UI`*>>: The UI of the App.
* <<Design-Logic,*`Logic`*>>: The command executor.
* <<Design-Model,*`Model`*>>: Holds the data of the App in-memory.
* <<Design-Storage,*`Storage`*>>: Reads data from, and writes data to, the hard disk.

Each of the four components

* Defines its _API_ in an `interface` with the same name as the Component.
* Exposes its functionality using a `{Component Name}Manager` class.

For example, the `Logic` component (see the class diagram given below) defines it's API in the `Logic.java` interface and exposes its functionality using the `LogicManager.java` class.

==== How the architecture components interact with each other

The _Sequence Diagram_ below shows how the components interact with each other for the scenario where the user issues the command `delete 1`.

.Component interactions for `delete 1` command
image::ArchitectureSequenceDiagram2.png[]

The sections below give more details of each component.

[[Design-Ui]]
=== UI component

.Structure of the UI Component
image::UiClassDiagram.png[]

*API* : link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/Ui.java[`Ui.java`]

The UI consists of a `MainWindow` that is made up of parts e.g.`CommandBox`, `ResultDisplay`, `PersonListPanel`, `StatusBarFooter` etc. All these, including the `MainWindow`, inherit from the abstract `UiPart` class.

The `UI` component uses JavaFx UI framework. The layout of these UI parts are defined in matching `.fxml` files that are in the `src/main/resources/view` folder. For example, the layout of the link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/MainWindow.java[`MainWindow`] is specified in link:{repoURL}/src/main/resources/view/MainWindow.fxml[`MainWindow.fxml`]

The `UI` component,

* Executes user commands using the `Logic` component.
* Listens for changes to `Model` data so that the UI can be updated with the modified data.


[[Design-Logic]]
=== Logic component
//tag::shaun-logic[]
==== Overview of Logic Component

[[fig-LogicClassDiagram]]
.Structure of the Logic Component
image::LogicClassDiagram2.png[]

*API* :
link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/logic/Logic.java[`Logic.java`]

.  `Logic` uses the `ParserManager` class to parse the user command.
.  This results in a `Command` object which is executed by the `LogicManager`.
.  The command execution can affect the `Model` (e.g. adding a question).
.  The result of the command execution is encapsulated as a `CommandResult` object which is passed back to the `Ui`.
.  In addition, the `CommandResult` object can also instruct the `Ui` to perform certain actions, such as displaying help to the user.
.  In quiz mode, the `CommandResult` object is also used to determine whether the user's answer is correct.

//end::shaun-logic[]

//tag::wilfred-overview[]
==== Managing parsing in Configuration and Quiz Mode
The Revision Tool uses two Parser interfaces (`Parser` and `QuizParser`) to parse different sets of commands (i.e. in Configuration Mode and in Quiz Mode).

.Class Diagram of ParserManager to display how parsers are created in both modes.
image::ParserClassDiagram.png[width=500]

As shown in the figure above, the `ParserManager` class is responsible for creating the respective parsers for Configuration and Quiz Mode.
This was designed while taking into consideration that the Quiz Mode Parsers (i.e. XYZParsers) will require
an extra `Answerable` argument on top of the user input String in order to carry out commands such as determining whether the user's input is the correct answer.
(E.g. to call methods such as Answerable#isCorrect(Answer))

As different commands are accepted in Configuration and Quiz Mode, the `ParserManager` class uses overloaded methods
(`parseCommand(String)` and `parseCommand(String, Answerable)` to determine the valid commands in each mode. If a Configuration Mode
command such as `add` were to be used in Quiz Mode, the ParserManager would deem the the command as invalid. +

With reference to Figure 6, The following are the parsers used in each mode:

* ABCParser (Configuration Mode):
** AddCommandParser
** DeleteCommandParser
** EditCommandParser
** FindCommandParser
** ListCommandParser
** StartCommandParser

* XYZParser (Quiz Mode):
** McqInputCommandParser
** TfInputCommandParser
** SaqInputCommandParser

A more detailed description of the implementation of parsing in Configuration and Quiz Mode and its design considerations
can be found in <<Implementation-ConfigQuiz>>.
//end::wilfred-overview[]

//tag::shaun-designmodel[]
[[Design-Model]]
=== Model component

.Structure of the Model Component
image::ModelClassDiagram2.png[]

*API* : link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/Model.java[`Model.java`]

The `Model`,

* stores a `QuestionBank` object that represents the Question Bank.
* stores the Question Bank data.
* exposes an unmodifiable `ObservableList<Answerable>` that can be 'observed' e.g. the UI can be bound to this list so that the UI automatically updates when the data in the list change.
* does not depend on any of the other three components.
//end::shaun-designmodel[]

//tag::wilfred-answerable[]
==== The `Answerable` Class

.Class Diagram of the Answerable Class
image::AnswerableClassDiagram.png[]

The main class that the Revision Tool operates on is the `Answerable` class.

Each `Answerable` class must have 1 `Question`, 1 `Difficulty` and can have any amount of categories associated with it.
The amount of answers that an `Answerable` can have depends on its type.

There are 3 subclasses of the `Answerable` Class which are: `Mcq`, `TrueFalse` and `Saq`. Each class defines it's
own rules on the validity of `Answer` s (highlighted in red in the class diagram) provided to it.

The following are the rules of validity for each subclass:

* Mcq: 4 answers in total. 1 correct answer, 3 wrong answers.
* TrueFalse: Either 'true' or 'false' as its answer.
* Saq: Any amount of answers.
[NOTE]
For all subclasses, there cannot be any duplicates of answers. For example, if an Mcq class has "option1" as one of its
wrong answers, it cannot have "option1" as its correct answer or another wrong answer.
//end::wilfred-answerable[]

//tag::shaun-storage[]
[[Design-Storage]]
=== Storage component

.Structure of the Storage Component
image::StorageClassDiagram2.png[]

*API* : link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/storage/Storage.java[`Storage.java`]

The `Storage` component,

* can save `Question Bank` objects in json format and read it back.
* can save the Test Bank data in json format and read it back.
//end::shaun-storage[]

[[Design-Commons]]
=== Common classes

Classes used by multiple components are in the `seedu.revision.commons` package.

== Implementation

This section describes some noteworthy details on how certain features are implemented.

//tag::shaun-add[]

=== Add questions feature
==== Implementation

The add questions mechanism is facilitated by `AddCommand`.
It extends `Command` that will read a user command and execute the command result.
Additionally, it implements the following operations:

* `AddCommand#addMcq()` -- Adds a mcq question to the question bank.
* `AddCommand#addShortAns()` -- Adds a short answer question to the question bank.
* `AddCommand#addTf()` -- Adds a True False answer question to the question bank.

These operations are exposed in the `Model` interface as `Model#addMcqCommand()`, `Model#addTfCommand()` and `Model#addShortAnsCommand()` respectively.

Given below is an example usage scenario and how the add questions mechanism behaves at each step.

Step 1. The user types `add type/mcq q/"string of question" x/option1 x/option2 y/option3 x/option4 cat/[UML] diff/[easy]`, this command adds a easy difficulty mcq question about UML with 4 options and option3 being the correct answer.

image::InitialState.png[]

Step 2. The command is being parse into the parser and the AddCommand object of type Command will be created.

image::FirstState.png[]

Step 3. The AddCommand object will call its `addMcq()` method, this method will read the command and store the question with the answers into the `test bank` accordingly.

image::SecondState.png[]

[NOTE]
If a command fails its execution, it will not save the question into the `revision tool`. It will however throw an invalid command exception.
//end::shaun-add[]

==== Design Considerations

===== Aspect: How add executes

** User enters the command "add ...".
** Command is taken in and parsed to validate if it is a valid command.
** Add command is executed.
** New question is saved in the question bank.

===== Aspect: Format of the add command

** Use a single line containing all the information of the question.
** Pros: Faster for user to add a question.
** Cons: Hard for user to memorize the long sequence which may cause invalid command input.
* **Other alternative we considered:** Use multiple steps to guide user on adding the question.
** Pros: User do not have to memorize the correct format and less chance for an invalid command input.
** Cons: Slow to add questions, requiring multiple steps to fully complete a question.

//tag::wilfred-implementation[]
[[Implementation-ConfigQuiz]]
=== Configuration and Quiz Mode
As different commands are available for Configuration and Quiz Mode, we have to determine which commands are valid based on
the state of the application. To do so, we had two main design considerations: The structure of the parser component and how to
determine which parser to use. We will discuss these considerations in the following segment.

==== Design Considerations
|===
|Aspect | Alternative 1 | Alternative 2 | Conclusion and Explanation
|Structure of the Parser Component
|Command parsers for both modes implement the same interface (i.e. implement both parse(String) and parse(String, Answerable) methods)
but for the method which is not used, throw an error if a client calls it.
|Command parsers belonging to each mode implement different interfaces (i.e. a `Parser` or `QuizParser` interface)
which dictates the parameters of their parse() methods. (i.e. parse(String) for Configuration Mode vs parse(String, Answerable) for Quiz Mode)
|Alternative 2 was implemented. The main reason for this choice was to adhere to the interface-segregation principle.
If alternative 1 were to be implemented, a Configuration Mode command may have to implement a parse(String, Answerable)
dummy method which it will not use. This is bad design as a client might be able to call the dummy method and receive
unexpected results. Thus, by separating the interfaces, clients will only need to know about the methods that they need.

|Determining which parser to use| Create two parser manager classes (i.e. `QuizParserManager` and `ParserManager`)
with accompanying `QuizLogicManager` and `LogicManager` classes whose methods will be called in `MainWindow` for Configuration Mode and
`StartQuizWindow` for Quiz Mode respectively.
|Use a single `ParserManager` class which has overloaded methods of parse(String) and parse(String, Answerable). A
single `LogicManager` will also implement `execute(String)` and `execute(String, Answerable)`. In Configuration Mode, the
`LogicManager` will call `execute(String)` as there is no need to take in an Answerable and in Quiz Mode, the `LogicManager`
will call `execute(String, Answerable) to initiate quiz-related commands.
|Alternative 2 was implemented. By doing so, we were able to adopt a facade design pattern. The main benefit would be that
the client doesn't need to know the logic involved in selecting which type of parser and logic to use. This hides the internal
complexity of the `ParserManager` class which will be responsible for determining which type of parser to use.
|===

==== Commands in Configuration Mode
In Configuration Mode, a single string is passed as an argument to the Logic#execute method (i.e. execute(String)).

Given below is the Sequence Diagram for interactions within the `Logic` component for the `execute("delete 1")` API call.

.Interactions Inside the Logic Component for the `delete 1` Command
image::DeleteSequenceDiagram.png[]

NOTE: The lifeline for `DeleteCommandParser` should end at the destroy marker (X) but due to a limitation of PlantUML, the lifeline reaches the end of diagram.

==== Commands in Quiz Mode
In Quiz Mode, a string and the current `Answerable` object are passed as arguments to the Logic#execute method. (i.e. execute(String, Answerable))
Given below is the Sequence Diagram for interactions within the `Logic` component for the `execute("c", answerable)` API call.

.Interactions Inside the Logic Component for the `c` input command.
image::QuizSequenceDiagram.png[width=790]

==== Key differences between Configuration Mode and Quiz Mode:

|===
|Configuration Mode | Quiz Mode
|Logic#execute takes in a single string. | Logic#execute takes in a String and an Answerable.
|No methods of answerables are called. | Answerable#isCorrect(Answer)) is called from the AnswerableInputCommands such as `McqInputCommand` to check whether the user's answer is correct.
|CommandResult is used to display feedback to the user| CommandResult is used to display feedback to the user and inform `LogicManager` whether the selected answer is correct.
|Model is used to save actions such as the addition/deletion of answerables. | Model is used to update the score history statistics.
|===

==== Implementation of CommandResult (Builder Design Pattern)
The `CommandResult` class is designed using a builder pattern to allow flexibility of values returned to the `LogicManager`.
To guard against null values, default values are provided to every field in the `CommandResult` class upon construction.
Objects that call `CommandResult` can choose to customise `CommandResult` according to their needs.

Below is a code snippet of the `CommandResultBuilder` and `CommandResult` class:

image::wilfred-commandwithfeedback.png[width=790]
image::wilfred-commandbuild.png[width=790]
image::wilfred-commandresult.png[width=790]

Examples of how to build a CommandResult:
....
CommandResult c = new CommandResultBuilder().withFeedback(message).withExit(true).build();
CommandResult c = new CommandResultBuilder().isCorrect(true).build();
....

//tag::wilfred-quiz[]
=== Quiz Mode
==== How the quiz works
After the user has `start` ed the quiz, the application enters Quiz Mode. The following is the flow of events after a quiz
session has started.

.Activity Diagram of a Quiz Session in `NormalMode`
image::QuizSessionActivityDiagram.png[width=790]

Elaboration of Steps:

. After the user has started either a normal / custom mode quiz. He/she will be prompted to key in their answer.
. If the input is valid, the revision tool will display the subsequent question until the level / entire quiz has ended.
. If the input is invalid, the revision tool will prompt the user to key in their input again with guidance provided on
the commands accepted.
. If the time limit is exceeded (e.g. 30 seconds in Normal Mode), the revision tool will mark the question as wrong and
move on to the next question.
. Once a level has ended, the user will be given the choice to move on to the next level or exit the quiz.
. Once the entire quiz has ended, the user will be given the choice to restart or exit the quiz.

[NOTE]
For Arcade Mode, when a users enters a wrong answer, the quiz will end.
//end::wilfred-implementation[]

//tag::shaun-restore[]
=== Restore feature
==== Implementation
The restore mechanism is facilitated by `RestoreCommand`.
It extends `Command` that will read a user command and execute the command result.
Additionally, it implements the following operations:

* `#handleRestore()` -- Prompts the user with an alert box if he really wishes to execute the restore function.
* `#setRevisionTool()` -- Clears the current question bank and reset it with our own default questions.

These operations are exposed in the `Model` interface as `Model#setRevisionTool()` and from `MainWindow` as `#handleRestore()` respectively.

==== Design Considerations
* When implementing the restore feature, we didn't want users to face a problem if they entered the command accidentally hence the alert popup was implemented, to prompt users if they really want to carry out the command before executing it.
* With this popup, users will now be more cautious when trying to restore and only do so when they really want to reset their revision tool.
* Furthermore, the questions that we included in the default revision tool question bank are questions taken from the lecture quiz and weekly quiz which are most probably deemed important by the professor himself.

===== Aspect: How Restore executes
** User enters the command "restore".
** Command is taken in and a popup is shown to reconfirm if the user would like to carry out the restore command.
** Upon clicking yes, restore command will be handled.
** Current questions will be deleted and default questions will reset to the revision tool.

//end::shaun-restore[]

//tag::shaun-autocomplete[]
=== AutoComplete feature
==== Implementation
* A set of commands and auto completed text are saved in a set.
* When users type a command on the text box, method `#populatePopup` will be called where the user's command will be matched against our SortedSet.
* If there is a match, a contextMenu showing all possible auto complete text will show up.
* This method is implemented such that the results in the contextMenu will change and show as the user is typing and this would make it more intuitive for users.

==== Design Considerations
* The main design consideration here would be to have value added auto complete list to pop up.
* How we managed that is to show:
** The basic command
** Basic command + possible parse commands where they can easily fill in.

image::AutoComplete2.png[]

===== Aspect: How AutoComplete works
** Users wishes to enter an "Add" command `add type/mcq q/What is 1 + 1 y/2 x/1 x/3 x/4 cat/easy diff/1`
** Upon typing either "a", "ad" or even "add", the auto complete context menu will pop up showing possible auto complete list, mainly:
*** add
*** add type/ q/ y/ x/ cat/ diff/
** Upon seeing that, users will be able to select those options or use those as a guideline to complete his commands more intuitively.
//end::shaun-autocomplete[]

=== Logging

We are using `java.util.logging` package for logging. The `LogsCenter` class is used to manage the logging levels and logging destinations.

* The logging level can be controlled using the `logLevel` setting in the configuration file (See <<Implementation-Configuration>>)
* The `Logger` for a class can be obtained using `LogsCenter.getLogger(Class)` which will log messages according to the specified logging level
* Currently log messages are output through: `Console` and to a `.log` file.

*Logging Levels*

* `SEVERE` : Critical problem detected which may possibly cause the termination of the application
* `WARNING` : Can continue, but with caution
* `INFO` : Information showing the noteworthy actions by the App
* `FINE` : Details that is not usually noteworthy but may be useful in debugging e.g. print the actual list instead of just its size

[[Implementation-Configuration]]
=== Configuration

Certain properties of the application can be controlled (e.g user prefs file location, logging level) through the configuration file (default: `config.json`).

[appendix]
== Instructions for Manual Testing

Given below are instructions to test the app manually.

[NOTE]
These instructions only provide a starting point for testers to work on; testers are expected to do more _exploratory_ testing.

=== Launch and Shutdown

. Initial launch

.. Download the jar file and copy into an empty folder
.. Double-click the jar file +
   Expected: Shows the GUI with a set of sample answerables. The window size may not be optimum.

. Saving window preferences

.. Resize the window to an optimum size. Move the window to a different location. Close the window by using the `x` button at the top right hand corner or by using the command `exit`.
.. Re-launch the app by double clicking the jar file. +
   Expected: The most recent window size and location is retained.

=== Adding an answerable

. Adding a MCQ to the current list

.. Test case: `add type/mcq q/What is 1 + 1 y/2 x/1 x/3 x/4 cat/easy diff/1` +
Expected: new MCQ answerable will be created and appended at the bottom of the list. Details of the the added answerable will be shown at the bottom of the list, and the correct answer will be highlighted in green.

. Adding a True False to the current list

.. Test case: `add type/tf q/What is 1 + 1 = 2 y/true cat/easy diff/1` +
Expected: new True False answerable will be created and appended at the bottom of the list. Details of the added answerable will be shown at the bottom of the list, and only the correct answer will be shown and highlighted in green.

. Adding a Short Answer Question (SAQ) to the current list

.. Test case: `add type/saq q/What is smaller than 10 but bigger than 7? y/8 y/9 cat/easy diff/1` +
Expected: new SAQ answerable will be created and appended at the bottom of the list. Details of the added answerable will be shown at the bottom of the list and all the correct answers state will be highlighted in green.

. Adding an Answerable that already exist in the Revision Tool
.. Test case: `add type/mcq q/What is 1 + 1 y/2 x/1 x/3 x/4 cat/easy diff/1` +
Expected: No new answerable will be added as the question already exist in the Revision Tool. An error message will be thrown, informing users that the answerable already exist in the Revision Tool.

=== Deleting an answerable

. Deleting an answerable while all answerables are listed

.. Prerequisites: List all answerables using the `list` command. Multiple answerables in the list.
.. Test case: `delete 1` +
   Expected: First answerable is deleted from the list. Details of the deleted answerable shown in the status message. Timestamp in the status bar is updated.
.. Test case: `delete 0` +
   Expected: No answerable is deleted. Error details shown in the status message. Status bar remains the same.
.. Other incorrect delete commands to try: `delete`, `delete x` (where x is larger than the list size) _{give more}_ +
   Expected: Similar to previous.

=== Starting quiz

. Starting a quiz
.. Test case: `start mode/normal` +
Expected: Start quiz window will pop up with a question showing under the command box and the answers in the result box further below. Answer the questions using the CLI accordingly to see the progress bar move till quiz completion. Users will be prompted if he wishes to proceed to level 2.
.. Test case: `start mode/arcade` +
Expected: Start quiz window will pop up similar to previous test case. The only difference would be that once the quiz proceeds and an incorrect answer is input, the quiz ends and the score will be shown. This is the "hard mode" of our quiz mode.
.. Test case `start mode/custom timer/3` +
Expected: Start quiz window will pop up similar to previous test case. The difference here will be the timer. Instead of the 30 seconds timer per question, the new timer (seen at the bottom right beside the status progress bar) will be at 3 seconds as set by the user.

=== Saving data

. Dealing with missing/corrupted data files

.. If there is a missing answerables data file, the RevisionTool will automatically create a default data file with all the default answerables inside.
.. If there is a corrupted answerable data file, the RevisionTool will automatically start with a list of empty file. Users will then be able to use the `#restoreCommand` here to get a list of default answerables or alternatively, create a new set of answerables manually.

. To identify missing/corrupted data files:
.. `.\data\revisiontool.json`
.. `.\data\history.json`
