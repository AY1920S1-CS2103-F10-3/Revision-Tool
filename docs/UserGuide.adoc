== Introduction

This CS2103/T Revision Tool (RT) is for those who *prefer to use a desktop app for storing question banks*.
More importantly, RT is *optimized for those who prefer to work with a Command Line
Interface* (CLI) while still having the benefits of a Graphical User Interface (GUI).
If you can type fast, RT can get your contact management tasks done faster than traditional
GUI apps. Interested? Jump to the <<Quick Start>> to get started. Enjoy!

== Quick Start
