== Introduction

This CS2103/T Revision Tool (RT) is for those who *prefer to use a desktop app for storing test banks*.
More importantly, RT is *optimized for those who prefer to work with a Command Line
Interface* (CLI) while still having the benefits of a Graphical User Interface (GUI).
If you can type fast, RT can get your contact management tasks done faster than traditional
GUI apps. Interested? Jump to the <<Quick Start>> to get started. Enjoy!

== Quick Start

.  Ensure you have Java `11` or above installed in your Computer.
.  Download the latest RT link:{repoURL}/releases[here].
.  Copy the file to the folder you want to use as the home folder for your `*test bank*`.
.  Double-click the file to start the app. The GUI should appear in a few seconds.

of the above x/Padifield diff/1 cat/Introduction` : adds an mcq question with x/ (as in a cross for "wrong") marking the wrong answers and
y/ (as in "yes") marking the correct answers. Difficulty: 1, Category: Introduction.
