== Introduction

`*Insert name*` is for those who *prefer to use a desktop app for storing test banks*.
More importantly, `*Insert name*` is *optimized for those who prefer to work with a Command Line
Interface* (CLI) while still having the benefits of a Graphical User Interface (GUI).
If you can type fast, `*Insert name*` can get your contact management tasks done faster than traditional
GUI apps. Interested? Jump to the <<Quick Start>> to get started. Enjoy!

== Quick Start

.  Ensure you have Java `11` or above installed in your Computer.
.  Download the latest `*Insert name*` link:{repoURL}/releases[here].
.  Copy the file to the folder you want to use as the home folder for your `*test bank*`.
.  Double-click the file to start the app. The GUI should appear in a few seconds.

e.g. typing *`help`* and pressing kbd:[Enter] will open the help window.
.  Some example commands you can try:

* *`list`* : lists all categories and difficulties for the user to choose.
* **`add`**`mcq/According to the textbook, which kind of project is more difficult? x/Greenfield x/Brownfield y/None
of the above x/Padifield` : adds an mcq question with x/ (as in a cross for "wrong") marking the wrong answers and y/ (as in "yes") marking the correct answers.
* **`delete`**`3` : deletes the 3rd question shown in the current list.
* *`exit`* : exits the app.

.  Refer to <<Features>> for details of each command.
